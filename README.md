## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively integrate a REST API into a web application and utilize the data to dynamically generate content. I also improved my skills in implementing a theme switcher feature for toggling between light and dark modes. Additionally, I gained experience on how to implement routing using page hash.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to further enhance my understanding about routing to streamline development processes. I also aim to improve my CSS skills and focus on creating more responsive and visually appealing designs.
